# What happened to me and how it continues

I lost motivation for Discord Bot development and am now focused on Web Development (frontend and Backend). I changed my direction completely as i am trying out new languages such as C++, PHP, SQL, Swift and more. Not only that, but I think I also have somehow "grown up" a little, not trying to judge anyone here. Likewise, I am trying to look into discord at least 2 or 3 times a year, but i don't think it's realistic because i am more focused on doing real-life stuff like going out with friends (my beautiful princess). You know. If you have any questions, please contact me via email at contact.nxBene@icloud.com . I am sorry for the people I have worked with or for. But I believe you can handle it well. 
Bye, Bene.
